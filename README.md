# FileManager plugin for CakeAdmin and CakePHP

This plugin allows you to manage your files and folders inside your `webroot` via the 
[CakeAdmin](https://github.com/cakemanager/cakephp-cakeadmin) panel.

> Note: This is a non-stable plugin for CakePHP 3.x at this time. It is currently under development and should be 
considered experimental.

## Installation

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using composer.

The recommended way to install composer packages is:

    composer require cakemanager/cakeadmin-filemanager:dev-master

Now load the plugin with the command:

    $ bin/cake plugin load -r -b FileManager

Congratulations, you are done! Login to your panel and click on the 'FileManager'-button. You will see a list of folders
and files located in your webroot.
